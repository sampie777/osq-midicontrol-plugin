# MIDI Control Plugin

For OBS Scene Queue

_By Samuel-Anton Jansen_

### How to use

**Installation**
1. Install plugin by copying JAR file into plugins directory of OBS Scene Queue

**Usage**
1. Select your MIDI device from the devices list
1. Hit Connect
1. Press one of the calibration control buttons to configure the MIDI command for that action
1. While in _Calibration..._ mode, hit/move a key on your MIDI device
1. When successful, _Calibration..._ mode will exit and the key is now usable

When you send a MIDI command from your device to OBS Scene Queue, the light next to the "Control on" button will flash. It will flash green if the key is recognized for a specific queue action, otherwise it will flash orange.

If you want to temporarily disable the MIDI device, use the "Control on" / "Control off" button.
